ðŸš€ Learning by Doing

While building my latest website, I realized something important:
ðŸ‘‰ Watching tutorials is helpful, but real growth comes from practice.

Development isnâ€™t just about writing codeâ€”itâ€™s about:

Reading and understanding existing code

Breaking problems into smaller steps

Debugging and improving with every attempt

This project taught me that consistent hands-on practice is the key to becoming a better developer.
